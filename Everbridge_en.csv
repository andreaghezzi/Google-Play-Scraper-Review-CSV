notifications either. Update: 1/8/18 - The app is getting better - more 
stable. More customization for the end-user would be nice. For example, 
ability to add additional alarm/notification sounds (the built-in ones are 
not good). I'd like to be able to change the alert sound based on the text 
of the notification. For example, if I get a notification including the 
words 'STRUCTURE FIRE', I'd like a certain tone. Yes - I get alerts for 
local incidents (I also get them via TXT and email, so these are a bit 
redundant). But... having to open and confirm each and every single 
notification is ridiculous. There should be options for: 1. Disable all 
confirmations; 2. Delete notification without reading, 3. Mass delete 
notifications without having to open each and every single one. Also, this 
app sends all alert notification sounds through the phone speaker, even 
when bluetooth headphones are connected - an option to send sounds to 
headphones or bluetooth would be very appreciated. The annoying user 
experience due to lack of options may have me uninstalling soon, which is a 
bummer as it is a tool many local governments in the Northern Virginia area 
use to communicate with their employees and citizens.",3

Lots of people could benefit from this if they understood what it does.

I really don't need to know about every traffic tie-up in the entire city, especially when I am spending the day at home.
